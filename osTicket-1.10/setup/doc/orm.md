osTicket ORM
============

Creating a new model
--------------------
Eventually, we will have scripts to create the orm model from a mockup file
with field definitions, complete with validation routines. Currently, the
model validation must be written manually, and the fields are assumed based
on the fields available in the database on fetch, and the name of the field
updated on update.
