    A password reset request has been submitted on your behalf for the
    helpdesk at %{url}.<br />
    <br />
    If you feel that this has been done in error, delete and disregard this
    email. Your account is still secure and no one has been given access to
    it. It is not locked and your password has not been reset. Someone could
    have mistakenly entered your email address.<br />
    <br />
    Follow the link below to login to the help desk and change your
    password.<br />
