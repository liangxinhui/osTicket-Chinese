    content: >
        <span class="doc-desc-title">Registration Method</span> and <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Registration Required</span> are used
        together to configure how users register and access the web portal
        of your help desk. The table below summarizes how the two settings
        are interpreted by the system.
        <table border="1" cellpadding="2px" cellspacing="0" style="margin-top:7px"
            ><tbody style="vertical-align:top;">
            <tr><th>Registration Required</th>

                    tickets.</td></tr>

client_verify_email:
    title: Require Email Verification
    content: >
        Disable this option to give your users immediate access to tickets
        via the "Check Ticket Status" login page in the client portal. If
        enabled, (which is the default), users will be required to receive
        an email and follow a link in the email to view the ticket.
        <br><br>
        Disabling email verification might allow third-parties (e.g. ticket
        collaborators) to impersonate the ticket owner.

allow_auth_tokens:
    title: Enable Authentication Tokens
    content: >
        Enable this option to allow use of authentication tokens to auto-login users on ticket link click.
