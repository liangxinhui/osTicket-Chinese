        Decide what to do with processed emails:
        <br/><br/>
        <span class="doc-desc-opt"><b>Move to Folder</b></span>:
        This will backup your email from the INBOX to a
        folder you specify. If the folder does not yet exist on the server,
        the system will attempt to automatically create it.
        (<b>Recommended</b>)
        <hr>
        <span class="doc-desc-opt"><b>Delete Emails</b></span>: This will delete
        your email from the INBOX once it is processed.
        <hr>
        <span class="doc-desc-opt"><b>Do Nothing</b></span>: This will leave emails
        in your INBOX. The system will record the
        message ids of your email and attempt not to refetch it. However,
        this option may cause duplicate tickets to be created.
        (<em>Not Recommended</em>)

smtp_settings:
    title: SMTP Settings
    content: >
        Email sent from the help desk can be sent through an SMTP server.
        This is recommended, if possible, as it will increase the likelyhood
        of email delivery and will make the emails less likely to be marked
        as spam.

header_spoofing:
    title: Allow Header Spoofing
    content: >
        Enable this to allow sending emails via this mail box from an address
        other that the one given in the <span class="doc-desc-title">Email
        Address</span> setting above.
        <br/><br/>
        This advanced setting is generally used when sending mail from
        aliases of this mail box.
